"Raw Data- Microcosms.xlsx" is the raw ddPCR results (copies/uL) and the normalized absolute abundance (copies/g) for each target gene (CYA, MICR, apcA, and, ANA) in the experimental microcosms and in the blank/control microcosms. This file also contains the total DNA yield (as ng/uL and normalized ng/g) and the ddPCR outputs for the samples used to calculate the limits of blank (LOB) and limits of detection (LOD).
